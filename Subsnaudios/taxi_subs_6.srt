3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:06,657
Hello

4
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:07,401
Hello

5
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:09,310
May I ask you a question?

6
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,541
Do you know, what is beatbox?

7
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:12,993
Yes

8
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:14,646
I'm just doing it

9
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:16,326
and I'd like to try to surprise you

10
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,807
What do you think about it?

11
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,583
To show something

12
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:19,583
What I can

13
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,389
Yes, you may

14
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,381
So cool

15
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:22,431
Thanks

16
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:23,517
Did I manage to surprise?

17
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,150
Yes, a lot!

18
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,049
Especially at the end

19
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,000
It's when I started doing fast?

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,672
Yes-yes-yes

21
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,118
Cool

22
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,344
It means, you like faster music

23
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:36,977
maybe, yes?

24
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,465
Yes, most likely

25
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,942
Is it a microphone there?

26
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:41,630
Yes, I have here

27
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:43,399
Attached to the neck,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

28
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,489
I didn't understand at the start

29
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,770
I thought at the start, that

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,162
Some robot is speaking

31
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,689
I'm a robot

32
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:53,543
When you said hello

33
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:56,040
Hello

34
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:56,583
Hello

35
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:01,200
May I ask you a question?

36
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,326
Yes, I'm listening to you

37
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,280
Can you hear me in the back
on the speaker?

38
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:04,788
Yes

39
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,064
I just do beatboxing 

40
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,134
Do you know, what is beatbox?

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,626
Yes

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,596
And I'd like to show you somehing

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:11,797
I am just interested

44
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:13,847
if I can surprise you or not

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,781
I've made a song about my cat

46
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:16,445
Can you imagine?

47
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,201
♫ I like cats ♫

48
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,528
♫ To pet them and to scratch ♫

49
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,613
♫ It's not gross to me ♫

50
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,045
♫ To clean up their crap ♫

51
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:36,341
♫ But my cat escaped ♫

52
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:37,653
♫ Now I'm really sad ♫

53
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:38,899
♫ For not being sad ♫

54
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:39,733
♫ I'll go and find him ♫

55
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:45,808
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

56
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:48,174
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

57
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:50,681
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

58
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:52,667
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

59
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:55,625
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

60
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,128
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

61
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,238
♫ Where's ♫

62
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:04,780
♫ The cat ♫

63
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,784
Powerful

64
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,291
Seriously, you do it yorself?

65
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,477
It seems that way because 
I have a microphone connected

66
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:18,125
Thank you

67
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:19,276
Cool

68
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,567
Really powerful

69
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:22,551
I'm impressed

70
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:24,848
A few days back

71
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,008
I installed subwoofer

72
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,264
A big one speaker in the back

73
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:27,817
Now

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,700
Basses

75
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:32,992
Cool

76
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:34,786
Unusual

77
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:36,218
Thank you very much

78
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,379
You really uplifted me

79
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:41,438
Nice

80
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,559
May I ask you a question?

81
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:46,985
Do you know, what is beatbox?

82
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:48,900
No, don't know

83
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,297
Maybe you heard when

84
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,075
Music made with lips

85
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,221
With no instruments

86
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:54,186
No, didn't hear

87
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:54,723
Like, drums

88
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:56,859
No, I didn't hear

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,417
I just started doing it recently

90
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,371
I'd like to show you something 

91
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:02,039
No, no need, I'm afraid

92
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:03,144
Afraid?!

93
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:04,049
Why?

94
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,802
Why the sound is like that?

95
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:07,083
I've made this on purpose

96
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:10,947
Are you from Russia?

97
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:11,339
Yes

98
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,133
Adorable

99
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,138
I got it from the start

100
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:14,786
We have a bit different guys

101
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,464
Our guys wouldn't do this

102
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:17,042
Why?

103
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,514
You're modern, you see

104
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:19,122
And ours...

105
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,775
Firstly, ours would be shy to show

106
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,353
You know, I have a friend 
from Karaganda 

107
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:23,262
He's such a beatboxer

108
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,161
He's beatboxing even better than me
(Check sp4rk on YouTube)

109
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:26,990
That's why you're wrong 

110
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:27,917
Yes?

111
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,809
Let me make something
to surprise a little bit

112
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:32,984
You can try

113
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,000
a quick one

114
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,333
Road police here,
for some reason

115
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,861
Turn right on the traffic light

116
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,223
OK

117
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,083
Damn

118
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,500
Are you learning somewhere?

119
00:05:42,771 --> 000:05:43,891
I've already learned

120
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,140
Actually

121
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:46,717
Huh?

122
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:47,802
What is it here? 

123
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,944
A microphone somewhere?

124
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:49,962
Yes, I have here

125
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,782
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, Oppa

126
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,398
That's why you have 
the echo here

127
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:53,681
Yes

128
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:55,546
Like this

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,711
Thank you

130
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,250
You're welcome

131
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,271
Have a nice evening

132
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,695
- Best of luck
- Thank you too

133
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:00,679
Did you like it?

134
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,651
Will you do like this?

135
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,110
Or you can dance only?

136
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:11,882
May I ask you a question?

137
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,103
You may

138
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,500
Do you know what is beatbox?

139
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,583
I heard of it, yes

140
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,530
I'd like to show you something

141
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,750
I do beatbox

142
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,785
Interesting, if I can surprise you?

143
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,368
I connected a microphone
specially for this

144
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:24,318
I get it

145
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,083
Don't mind if I'll make something?

146
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:26,681
Let's go

147
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,727
Cool

148
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,186
Thank you very much

149
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:36,286
And all this goes to YouTube?

150
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes, and if you don't mind
I'll upload the clip with you

151
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,867
Should be funny

152
00:07:58,721 --> 00:07:59,083
Hello

153
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:00,250
Hello

154
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:03,319
May I ask you a question?

155
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,281
Yes, of course

156
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:05,822
Do you know what is beatbox?

157
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,636
Of course, I do

158
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,935
Why "of course"?

159
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,152
Because I do music myself

160
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,009
Beatbox?

161
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,195
Not beatbox

162
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,632
It seems you're recording

163
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:16,810
Well, I... Actually, yes

164
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,083
- I got it from the start
- Well, I don't drive without

165
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, oppa, damn

166
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,083
I'd like to perform something

167
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,417
No problems

168
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,975
It's nice, nice one

169
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,894
Have you tried recording?

170
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,917
Yes, I record

171
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,455
Upload to YouTube

172
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:17,777
Some routines

173
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:18,461
Thank you

174
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,525
I own a little record studio

175
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:21,000
Seriously?

176
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:22,400
No words

177
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:23,766
What a 

178
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,016
- Coincidence
- Coincidence

179
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:26,891
I got it from the start

180
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,917 
I see, a phone turned this way

181
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:29,725 
can't be for no reason

182
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,702
I installed subwoofer recently 

183
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:35,031
It goes hard

184
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,750
Earlier I was recording 
without subwoofer

185
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,883
The sound was so-so

186
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:40,365
There was lack of lows

187
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,848
The only thing is

188
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,563
Distortion occurs

189
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,250
Nothing to do with this.
