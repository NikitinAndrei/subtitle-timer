00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello!

2
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:04,368
How's your New Year's mood?

3
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:06,047
It's very good

4
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,322
The thing is, 
I'm a Santa's Helper

5
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:11,733
He told me to uplift
people's moods in a taxi 

6
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,498
And I've decided to sing
Christmas songs

7
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,617
Do you mind if I'll 
sing you something? 

8
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,168
No

9
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:07,687
Here was a routine

10
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:09,179
Awesome!

11
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,051
Do you know how it's called?

12
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:13,521
Beatbox?

13
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,463
Beatbox, yes!

14
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,242
I have a bag with presents

15
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:20,333
And you have a unique
opportunity

16
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,089
to get one of these presents

17
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:23,950
If you'll try 
to repeat something

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,133
from what I did

19
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:25,937
Let's try

20
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:29,248
Let's try together with me

21
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,388
That's it, excellent!

22
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,500
You've deserved a present

23
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,375
From Santa Claus

24
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,616
Just put your hand there

25
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,833
Ohhh, thank you

26
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,463

00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:07,745
Santa Claus has already paid

40
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:08,710
Actually, I'm his helper

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,283
He told me to drive 
and uplift people's mood

42
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:11,926
in a taxi

43
00:02:12,20 --> 00:02:13,017
Thank you!

44
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:14,200

54
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:30,333

55
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:31,646
Santa Claus! Who else?

56
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:32,622
You don't say!

57
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:34,500
Of course! I told you,
I'm his helper

58
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:36,833

Cute little fir tree
Is freezing in the cold

180
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:01,936
Take it from forest,
It is warm at home

181
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:06,179 
Take it from forest,
It is warm at home

182
00:11:08,329  --> 00:11:12,862 
Hand in hand in circle
Cheerful and happy

183
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,698
I've really forgotten

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,081
Hello, Sara!

Let's go!

192
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:33,203
There was a Fir-Tree 
born in woods

193
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:35,702
And there she was grown,

194
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:38,375
In winter and in summer both

195
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,667
The grace and green she was

196
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,506
In winter and in summer both

197
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,000
The grace and green she was

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,516
The snow around the thicky woods

199
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:50,996
Is creaking under skid

200
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:53,424
A shaggy Gee-Gee frisks ahead

201
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:55,877
In greatest rush indeed

202
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:58,202
A shaggy Gee-Gee frisks ahead

203
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:00,667
In greatest rush indeed

204
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,264
The Gee-Gee's carrying firewoods

205
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,718
On them there is a Man

206
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:08,223
He chopped down our little Fir

207
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,393
At the very rootlet

208
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:13,234
He chopped down our little Fir

209
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,765
At the very rootlet

210
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:18,167
And now in gallant here she is

211
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,776
On feast to us she came

212
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,410
And many many joyances

213
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,554
All little kids she gave

214
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:28,524
And many many joyances

215
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:33,173
All little kids she gave 

216
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,523
Wait a second we 
have to film something

217
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,143
Something?

218
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:37,693
Yeah, wait a little bit

219
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:41,903
Here's a gift for you

220
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:43,220
Amazing!

221
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,899

222
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,921

health and love!

223
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,496
And all the best wishes to you!
