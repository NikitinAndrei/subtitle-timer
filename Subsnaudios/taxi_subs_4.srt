00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,169
- Hello
- Hello

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:9,000
- May I ask you a question?
- Yes

3
00:00:9,319 --> 00:00:10,299
Do you know what beatbox is?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I just started practicing it recently 
and I want to show you something to rate me 

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,199
Because I am yet afraid to show it
to the big audience

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,800
You know... I am not a specialist

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I need an opinion of a regelar 
listener

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,359
- Let's go then...
- How it is listenable

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,489
Let's go then

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,610
That's so cool

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,010
You need to do it, and if you started
recently

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,010
You're very talented

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,010
Amazing, so classy

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,010
Thank you :)

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,710
Well done

16
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,510
Thank you very much

17
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,510
- Hello
- Hello

18
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,000
How do you know what door to drive to?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You wrote it, don't you?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ahah, no

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We saw that you are coming

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,000
What the #@%k?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Listen, I hear the sound like it's
coming out of speakers

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, he speaks, yeah

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,000
As I speak, do you hear me in the back?

26
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,000
I hear a bit too much

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,000
Like in a plane

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
- Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
- Like in a plane. Why?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I did it on purpose for me
to sound better

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I thought for me to hear better

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And for you to hear better

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,300
I thought I've got something 
with my head  

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,800
And with someone's next

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think I'm already on a plane

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
Let me show something, 
I am a musician after all

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,100
Let's go

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,100
But we are almost arrived

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,100
It's exactly two minutes left

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Let's go, let's go, there is
a long traffic light in front of us

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,000
That's fun

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,800
It's like an physiotherapy for an 
asthmatic?

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Well, yes
It helps me, btw

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What instrument did you do?

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,000
Drums

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,500
And vocals of course

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
- I think, yes
- Can't belive, I can't belive

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've seen something like this 
only on the TV

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's like an orchestra man

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Hello

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,000
We're ordering a pizza
We're ordering a pizza

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,000
We're ordering a pizza

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Come on, come on, more

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Amazing!

♪We're ordering a pizza!♪

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Wow, that's amazing!

58

Thank you! 

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A vehicle audio is useless here

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
May I ask you a question?

61
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you know what beatbox is?

62
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,000
Noo

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's when a music made with lips 
and mouth

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe ever heard? 

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I did.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I just ride and entertain 
people a little bit

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Maybe you can hear me 
also in the back?

68
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
I wanted to try something and
maybe I'll surprise you

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,300
Let's go

71
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,300
That's so cool I am shocked!

72
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
And why... Why are you still here?

73
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
You need to go further, 
somewhere bigger. So cool!

74
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,200
Thank you

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Very talented! Can't believe it

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I heard it of course,
but this much cool - never

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really never heard

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
- Thank you very much, very pleasant
- It's so cool

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
- Hello
- Hello

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
- May I ask you a question?
- Mhm

81
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,800
Do you know what beatbox is?

82
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, I heard. And why are you 
speaking into mic?

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to perform you beatbox,
I started doing it recently

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that's why I've plugged 
a special mic

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
- Just to sing beatbox?
- Just to sing beatbox, yeah

86
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,300
Wow, let's try then

87
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh my! Cool!

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's cool! I liked it

89
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
Is it your hobby?

90
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, yes, you can say 
I do it professionally 

91
0:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,500
on some level.
Because I perform sometime

92
0:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
When I sat and understood
that you are speaking into mic

93
0:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,500
I thought "Why are you speaking 
into mic?". Weird.

94
0:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And the camera of the phone
pointed this way

95
0:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
was a little bit confusing

96
0:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I thought "What is this hidden 
camera?"

97
0:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Can I see your microphone?

98
0:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You won't see it because
it's right here

99
0:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
on the neck

100
0:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,200
I've connected it there

101
0:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,600
Hello

102
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,100
Hello

103
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,100
May I ask you a question?

104
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,100
Yes

105
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Do you know what beatbox is?

106
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,100
What?

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,700
Do you know what is beatbox?

108
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I just started doing it 
not so long ago

109
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,100
And I want to perform you something,
if you don't mind

110
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,400
For you to rate. Huh?

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,100
I don't mind

112
00:09:30,500 --> 00:08:31,000
Awesome

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,300
Awesome!

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
Is it really you?

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,300
I've got a mic also

116
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Maybe you can hear that you hear 
me there as I speak

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,300
Yes, I hear

118
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
It's like, you know, it's like
some music started

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
It's really like a recording has
started

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,500
That's cool

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
And you do it professionally?

122
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, yes

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And you win something maybe?

124
0:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
I am a Russian beatbox champion,
to be honest

125
0:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Of Russia?

126
0:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,000
Can't believe it

127
0:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,000
Astonishing

128
0:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Wow, that's fun

129
0:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,500
Thank you very much

130
0:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,700
I am glad you liked it

131
0:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And I was like

132
0:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,700
"Is it really a human voice?"
