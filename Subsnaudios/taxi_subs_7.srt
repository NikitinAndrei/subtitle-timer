00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:10,483
Hello

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,357
From this side

3
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:14,655
Do you know what is beatbox?

4
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,092
Maybe ever heard?

5
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:18,645
No, to be honest

6
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,896
Or maybe you've heard when with help

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,385
of mouth or speech apparatus

8
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:24,341
people make music with no instruments

9
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:27,795
Ah, yes, I'm recalling something

10
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:29,535
I do it regullary

11
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:31,076
I'd like to show something

12
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:33,188
Maybe I'll manage to surprise you

13
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:34,053
Yes

14
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:36,027
I have a microphone connected
specially for this

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,152
I'm sitting and seeing like 
"a microphone?"

16
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:49,197
Cool

17
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:50,522
No, really

18
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,760
It's well done

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,802
Is it only your accompaniment?

20
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:54,750
Yes-yes

21
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:56,607
Cool, I even recorded on video

22
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,597
It is really just a mic amplifies,
I mean

23
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:01,610
without a microphone

24
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:11,037
I see

25
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:13,582
Hello

26
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:17,597
Do you know what is beatbox?

27
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:18,905
What?

28
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,532
I don't even know

29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,108
Maybe you've ever heard when

30
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:26,575
Music is made with mouth 
and no instruments

31
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:26,886
Yes

32
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:29,396
I've just started doing it

33
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:30,695
And I'd like to show you something

34
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:32,097
For you to rate

35
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,699
If it's listenable from aside

36
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,010
I've even connected the mic 
for this

37
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:37,083 
Let's go

38
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,405
It was cool

39
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:49,829
Yes

40
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,125
Really cool

41
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:52,331
Thank you

42
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:53,950
Did I manage to surprise?

43
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,136
Yes

44
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,936
Really cool

45
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:57,802
Can you do it again?

46
00:03:58,589 --> 00:03:59,125
Something else?

47
00:03:59,178 --> 00:03:59,533
Yes

48
00:03:59,533 --> 00:03:59,862
Yes

49
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,761
So cool

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,923

52
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:20,286
Cool

53
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:21,420
Thank you

54
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,778
Do you know what is beatbox?

55
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:28,051
Beatbox?

56
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,262
Is it when 
music is made with mouth?

57
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,681
In short, I do it 

58
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,950
I'd like to show something 

59
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:36,265
Maybe I can surprise you

60
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:37,375

00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,054

67
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:33,673
Do you know?

68
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,357
No, I don't

69
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,486
I do it and I'd like 
to make something

70
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,438
Let's go

71
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:51,639

Of course!

76
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,728
You may even talk with us

77
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,511
I usually talk a lot

78
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:05,875
I'll make music myself

79
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:06,625
With mouth

80
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,570
Do you know what is beatbox?

81
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:09,445
We know

82
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,750
I liked it all

83
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:36,352
Yes 

84
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,135
It's actually very cool

85
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,551
I just didn't get
how's a microphone there

86
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:40,836
How?

87
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:41,736
Like that

00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,520
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

89
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,208
Ok, now I get it

90
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,051
I didn't see it from the start 

91
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:50,678
Are your speakers boosted?

92
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:51,855
I have a subwoofer 
installed there

93
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:56,019
As I thought there's something
installed in the back

94
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:56,703
Yes, it's like

94
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,394
Do you perform somewhere
in Karaganda?

94
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:05,151
No. I didn't perform even once
