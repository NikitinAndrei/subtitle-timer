1
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,050
Can I turn on music?

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,448
No problem, turn on

3
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:11,607
Anything, but rap

4
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,967
What music is this?

5
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:24,595
Ah, it's you doing this?

6
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:27,667
You don't say!

7
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,167
May I film you, bro?

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,423
You are so

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,130
Wait a sec

10
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:35,901
Wait a sec my guy!

11
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,378
Usually, I don't like this

12
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,188
but damn it's nice to hear this

13
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:54,470
Oppa, brotha's spitting fire
like crazy 

14
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:07,792
Can you make it again?

15
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,564 
My goodness!

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,632
Nice one!

17
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,624
Cmon, a goody, a goody

18
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:38,612
It's forward

19
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,509
It's incorrect?

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,026
Forward

21
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:55,618
That's good

22
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:57,825
Nice one

23
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:01,421
My gosh

24
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,333
Is it a program or what?

25
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,184
No, just lips

26
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:05,065
And what's this?

27
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:05,931
Just a microphone

28
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,000
You don't say!

29
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,860
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,448
My goodness!

31
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:11,488
Low five!

32
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,719
Is it your feature?

33
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,667
Something ike that

34
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,735
Drive'n'entertain people

35
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:17,149
Fudge, you're cool

36
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,935
I like you

37
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,635
And I didn't get it 
from the start

38
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:24,873
It's like music started

39
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:26,747
And after I saw it
I'm like "naaah"

40
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,597
And you said
"Can I turn on music?"

41
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,463
You heard on the Internet
something like that?

42
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:32,392
I've never heard

43
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:32,932
First time?

44
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,860
Yes

45
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,424
That's cool

46
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,441
You don't mind 
if I turn on music?

47
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:40,648
Nah, it's OK, turn on

48
00:03:58,362 --> 00:03:59,283
It was you?

49
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,150
Nice one!

50
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,538
Thank you

51
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:03,911
It was very 
beautiful, seriously

52
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:04,783
Thank you

53
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,822
Did you think 
it was music playing?

54
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,762
Do you know more or

55
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:14,313
only this song?

56
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,041
Actually, I've got 
more songs

57
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,813
Well done, brother

58
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:50,461
Thanks

59
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:53,901
Можете отметить меня, 
если загрузите в Инстаграм?

60
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:04,707
Oh, 30 thousands

61
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,559
Well done

62
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:01,755
Thanks

63
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,629
Can I turn on music?

64
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,485
I don't care

65
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:05,777
You can turn on

66
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,192
It's better with music

67
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:16,874
I am always on 
the wheel myself

68
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:29,920
Awesome!

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,870
How do you like this 
kind of music?

70
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,395
Have you ever heard 
something like this?

71
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,367
I don't even know

72
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,333
A human orchestra 
they call it

73
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,569
We try to imitate 
sounds of music

74
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,024
Usually drum sounds

75
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,273
We didn't have this
back in my days

76
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,098
Can I turn on music?

77
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,907
You know better

78
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:55,922
No sh#t

79
00:08:57,408 --> 00:08:58,474
Well executed

80
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,784
I thought at the start
there are speakers

81
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,738
Then I look at you

82
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,161
A beatboxer?

83
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,873
Yes! Beatbox! 
It's called beatbox

84
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:09,716
I am gladly surprised
people know

85
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,058
that it is beatbox and all this
is called beatbox

86
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:13,463
Young people know

87
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:16,306
Can I turn on music?

88
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:18,115
I'm a robot

89
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:21,878
I must

90
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:25,738
I'm a robot

91
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:29,373
I must

92
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,333
must

93
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,508
I'm a dummy robot

94
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,300
I must dance

95
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,093
A dummy robot

96
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,000
I must dance

97
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,841
A dummy robot

98
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,667
I must dance

99
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:05,101
How do you like this music?

100
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,199
Awesome

101
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:11,465
It seems I've seen you before

102
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,387
To be honest, 
I am a Russian beatbox champion 

103
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,667
Current

104
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,244
Yes?

105
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:15,777
Yes

106
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,846
I came about 
three months ago

107
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,176
Maybe that's why
you've seen me somewhere

108
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,744
Now you'll stop here?

109
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,847
Yet here, maybe 
I'll go to Almaty next month
