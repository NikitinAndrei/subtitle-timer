1
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,357
Do you know what is beatbox?

2
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:10,141
Yes, a bit

3
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:12,942
I'm practicing, and I'd like 
to show you something

4
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:13,692
How I do it

5
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:14,970
and you could rate it

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,964
Yes, let's go

7
00:01:33,00 --> 00:01:34,333
Well done, well done

8
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:36,921
Thank you

9
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:41,809
Do you know what is beatbox?

10
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:45,420
Maybe ever heard once	

11
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,962
When music is made with lips?

12
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,161
I've just started 
practicing it recently

13
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,358
and I'd like to make something
for you

14
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,372
If you don't mind

15
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:54,893 
Let's go

16
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:14,305
Powerful

17
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:17,167
Thank you

18
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,155
Hello

19
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:19,633
Hello

20
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:21,851
Why does your voice 
sounds so strange?

21
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:22,654
How strange?

22
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,530
It sounds like a dubbed voice

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,299
It's just a joke

24
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:30,949
I'm driving and having fun

25
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,059
Do you know what is beatbox?

26
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:32,645
Yes

27
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:34,412
I'm a beatboxer

28
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:35,000
a good one

29
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,167
And I can perform you something,
if you want

30
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,280
Let's go

31
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,408
I've written a song 
about my cat

32
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:41,283
My cat escaped

33
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:42,852
And I'm really upset

34
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:42,546
I wrote a song

35
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:51,773
♫ I like cats ♫

36
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,950
♫ To pet them and to scratch ♫

37
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,390
♫ It's not gross to me ♫

38
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,689
♫ To clean up their crap ♫

39
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,068
♫ But my cat's escaped ♫

40
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:58,225
♫ Now I'm really sad ♫

41
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,544
♫ For not to be sad ♫

42
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:00,862
♫ I'll go and find him ♫

43
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:01,735
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

44
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:04,453
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

45
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:06,969
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

46
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:09,465
♫ Where's the cat? ♫

47
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:33,973
It's funny 

48
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:36,333
Thank you

49
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,112
I'm also a musician

50
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:40,729
Do you play something?

51
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,224
I've finished Choir Directing

52
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:45,172
I play piano and sing

53
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:48,398
Now I study
Higher Pop & Jazz Singing

54
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:49,534
What a twist!

55
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:51,583
Maybe you can sing something
and I'll make beatbox

56
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,592
I don't even know, I'm scared

57
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:18,810
Cool!

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,763
Awesome!

59
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:20,737
Really well done

60
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:23,902
Awesome!

61
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,824
Do you know what is beatbox?

62
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:30,618
I don't

63
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,478
Maybe ever heard when music's
made with lips?

64
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,919
Without instruments

65
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:35,611
With lips?

66
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:40,823
I'm practicing it. And I'd 
like to show you something

67
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,507
Maybe I'll uplift your mood

68
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:29,920
Awesome!

69
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,152
First time hearing!

70
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,897
Do you know what is beatbox?

71
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,691
I'm practicing it and I'd like
to perform you something

72
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,740
Interesting, 
if I can surprise you

73
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,572
Let's go

74
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh my! Awesome!

75
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:27,205
Did you like it?

76
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:29,667
First time in my life
I'm listening to beatbox

77
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:30,775
Amazing, it's cool

78
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:32,438
For how long do you do it?

79
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:34,426
For about 15 years

80
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:34,933
Awesome

81
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:36,819
Right from the chorus

82
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:49,508
Cool!

83
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:50,205
Awesome!

84
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:51,759
Do you know what is beatbox?

85
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,692
Beatbox? Yes

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,445
While we're in a traffic jam

87
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm a beatboxer

88
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:56,860
A good one

89
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,234
I can make something for you

90
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:58,667
Really?

91
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,748
Maybe I'll uplift your mood

92
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:00,167
Let's go

93
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:34,667
It was astonishing

94
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:36,906
Thank you very much

95
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,610
Such a talant!

96
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:40,089
Thank you

97
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,586
I didn't expect the flex 
with a microphone

98
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:45,917
Unexpected plot twist

99
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:46,813
When I pulled out a mic

100
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,503
Thank you 

101
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:49,862
Do you make songs remixes 
more often or self-composed? 

102
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:54,345
I have self-composed as well

103
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,765
People like remixes more

104
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,410
because they hear
familiar track

105
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,697
and go "Ohh that's the piece,
I know that"

106
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,252
start dancing, 
give a better reaction

107
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:08,000
I have my own song,
I can make it right now

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,049
Yes, let's go

109
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,301
It's powerful! Damn

110
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:20,892
It's hard 

111
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:21,510
Thank you

112
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,506
I like it a lot

113
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:26,032
I think it's hard 
to sit to these beats

114
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:28,025
No chances

115
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,667
It starts craving to do like

116
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,500
Some instincts?

117
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,333
Yeah instincts

118
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,149
I can't help myself

119
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:39,799
Gice me a fist bump

120
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,000
That's it

121
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,210
Thank you for the mood

122
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,333
Thank you either

123
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,023
Good bye!

124
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:44,760
Good bye!
