00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,300
- Hello
- Hello

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,500
May I ask you a question?

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,000
- Yes
- Of course

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you know, what is beatbox?

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I just do it for a little
and want to show you something.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
See, I have a mic attached and 
you can hear me in the back, don't you?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, indeed

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Perfectly hear

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,610
I'll make something. You don't mind?

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,510
Yes, we don't mind

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,810
Wow! Amazing! Is it real?

13
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,010
- Really cool!
- Really powerful!

14
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,010
Just *applauses*

15
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,010
Thank you very much

16
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,010
I don't regret I sat on 
the front seat

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you very much. 
Such an amazing reaction! 

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,500
It is really cool

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,500
It is reaaally cool

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
It seems you do it 
profesionally, don't you?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,100
Well, yes. Maybe, for about 15 years

22
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,000
Wowzer! Now i get it 

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Wow, such a lucky ride

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,800
Have you ever heard something like this?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
No, only on the internet, never live

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,500
Maybe, that's why you have
such a reaction

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Maybe

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Really powerful, very cool

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you very much

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, you can go on a talent show

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Well, yes, I would go

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you have some of them
in Kazakhstan?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
I just came from Russia recently

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,800
I get it then

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,100
Will we see ourselves semewhere?

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,100
If you want, I can add you 
to the video. If you don't mind. 

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,100
You can even find me and 
watch yourselves later 

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
On Insta?

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,100
No, on Youtube

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,000
You have 43K subscribers! Oh my!

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm subscribing. I subscribed now

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Thank you

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,000
Amazing

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Oh my god, it's here, right?

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Hi, everyone!

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll come

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A celebration or something?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Kinda

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Or vice versa?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
yeah, vice versa

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,700
What happend?

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,000
What happend?

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, everything is fine

54
00:03:22,000--> 00:03:23,500
Do you know, what is beatbox?

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Bimox?

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Beat. Box.

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,500
Beatbox?

58
00:03:27,500--> 00:03:28,000
Yeah 

59
00:03:30,000--> 00:03:31,000
Don't know

60
00:03:31,000--> 00:03:32,300
Never ever heard?

61
00:03:32,600--> 00:03:35,000
I'm 47... 50

62
00:03:35,000--> 00:03:38,000
When music is made with lips.
Heard it?

63
00:03:38,400--> 00:03:39,000
Yeah

64
00:03:39,000--> 00:03:40,600
Drums and stuff 

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
Ah... The three, the three...

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
One person makes music 
with no instruments 

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Actually, it was three of them

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
I do beatbox and want to show you
something 

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
For you to listen

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I... do not ardfwst...

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,500
Huh?

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't argue with that

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
May I show you something, yeah?

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,700
Of course

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh my gosh

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's strong... I agree

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Cool, cool

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Seriously speaking, very cool

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Huh, f*ck...

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Not a lot of people here swim out,
actually

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Actually speaking,
there is only one life

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And it's a fight

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, and what?

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fudge, it's cool

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Seriously speaking, a nice one

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like...

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
F*ck...

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well done

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,500
All the best, have a nice day!

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Ouch, you're shocking me again

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Have a nice one!

94
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I can, I can

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Best of luck

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Thank you

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Hello

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,400
Hello

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
May I ask you a question?

98
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,600
Do you know, what is beatbox?

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,000
When music is made with lips.
Maybe ever heard once?

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,500
No

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,400
On TikTok

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,100
I just do it and

101
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
I want to perform you something

101
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,000
You can hear in the back I have
a mic attached

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
Can you hear me?
One, two, three, four...

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,500
And I want to perform you something,
maybe I'll manage to surprise you 

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe to uplift your mood

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, let's go

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
I'll check the sound

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,000
You can hear me well there?

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
- Cool
- Cool

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,300
Thanks

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Have you ever heard something 
like this live?

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Live? No

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Only on the Internet, yes?

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Yes

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,500
It is very cool

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Honestly, I make videos and if you
don't mind, I'll add you

116
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,000
How you are reacting

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
On TikTok?

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
On YouTube. You can find there
and watch later, if you want 

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,800
On YouTube just type "Improver"

120
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
In English

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Are you self-taught or have 
been studying somewhere?

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I do it for about 15 years 

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Since the very young age. I heard

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
how they do it, and tried to 
replicate it

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,000
from video

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Even became campion of Russia

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Why don't you record a track?

128
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you mean self composed song
with beatbox?

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Actually, I have songs I made
myself with beatbox, like

130
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,000
Cool

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
It should be nice to dance to it

132
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, a dance club one

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Hello

134
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,000
Hello

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you know, what is beatbox?

136
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,500
Beatbox?

137
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
Maybe ever heard a word once?

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
I heard a word, but don't know
what is it

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
When a person with his mouth and
his speech apparatus

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
makes music. Maybe heard it?

142
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,000
On TikTok maybe

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ahh, got it, yes-yes

144
00:09:30,500--> 00:09:32,600
I just started doing it

145
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
And I wonder, how it is listenable
by another person

146
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Will I surprise you or not?

147
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Let me perform you something

148
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
And you will tell me
if it's fine or not

149
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Usually, young people are
interested in this

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You call yourself an old man 
too early

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am 60 in two years

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's amazing

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,700
You look young, don't look your age.

154
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,400
It should be, 
everyone say this to you

155
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll make something?

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,500
Let's go

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,500
Yes. Impressing

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
How much breath it takes

159
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes, long years of training

160
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
How do you do all this?

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you break it down into steps,

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Then, as in every

163
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
kind of art, for example,

164
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
fighters perfects a basic punch,

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
a dancer - basic moves

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,400
If you want to learn a language,
you need to learn its alphabet,

167
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,300
And here the same

168
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,000
You need to know basic sounds,
percussive sounds

169
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,500
It's a kick, the biggest drum,

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
a hi-hat, that we hit,

171
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,000
and a small drum that sounds like

172
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Having these three sounds

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500 
allowing us make some rythms

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,500 
It's only three sounds

175
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,700
How's that all called? 
How have you said?

176
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,700
How's this all called? 
What is it, you have said?

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Beatbox

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hello

179
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Salam

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
Why is it so loud?

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2

182
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,300
What does it mean?

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
I just have a mic attached

184
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Ah, s&*t, I got scared

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Gosh, you make jokes

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I think "A special department maybe"

187
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,200
Actually, I do beatbox. 
Do you know what is this?

188
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,800
Ah! Yes

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
I am Russian beatbox champion

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You don't say!

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,800
And we can even listen to it?

192
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
It's all here for a reason

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,500
As I thought

194
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,600
And you go 
"Turn it off, turn it off"

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Bro, may I record?

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,400
You may record

197
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Gosh! You don't say!

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,500
I will post it, and everyone will
"Sheesh, you are with the beatbox world champ"

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You start?

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Who are you? 

208
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,300
Amazing

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Gosh you're lit

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh my God, bro! 
I pressed on photo, you know
