1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,947
That's it! Quiet!

2
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,859
Do you know, what is beatbox?

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:12,422
Beatbox?

4
00:00:012,689 --> 00:00:13,035
Yes

5
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:09,310
May I ask you a question?

6
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,541
Do you know, what is beatbox?

7
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:12,993
Yes

8
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,546
I do it and I'd like 
to perform you something

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,446
Let's go

10
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:17,807
Can I film you?

11
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:18,515
You can film

12
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,180
I've made a song about my cat

13
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:22,929
For you to rate

14
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:24,803
Will you film?

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,773
â™« I like cats, â™«

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,148
â™« To pet them and to scratch â™«

17
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:40,363
â™« It's not gross to me â™«

18
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:41,678
â™« To clean up their crap â™«

19
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:42,973
â™« But my cat escaped â™«

20
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:44,128
â™« Now I'm really sad â™«

21
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,403
â™« For not to be sad â™«

22
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:46,500
â™« I'll go and find him â™«

23
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:47,635
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

24
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:49,946
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

25
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:52,575
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

26
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,066
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

27
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:57,556
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

28
00:00:59,409 --> 00:00:59,907
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

29
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:02,397
â™« Where's the cat? â™«

30
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:08,932
â™« Where's â™«

31
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:11,601
â™« The cat? â™«

32
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,307
So cool!

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,599
Cool, cool

35
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:24,531
Nice one

36
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,627
How's the song?

37
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:27,241
Cool song

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,476
You've lost the cat?

39
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:29,133
Yes

40
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:30,109
I've lost

41
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,026
That's all

42
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:31,942
The cat ran away from me

43
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:35,249
Have you heard live 
beatbox before?

44
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:36,445
Live? No

45
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:37,222
First time?

46
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:37,660
Yes

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,975
It's nice

48
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:40,090
How long do you do it?

49
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:40,449
For about 15 years

50
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,696
For 15 years?

51
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,569
Amazing

52
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,896
You've reacted very cool,
to be honest

53
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:49,594
Because, usually,

54
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,681
Especially, when elder people sit

55
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,216
They don't understand 
what's happening

56
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:55,212
Who's donig what

57
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,180
They probably don't know
what's beatbox

58
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,136
I explain to them firstly

59
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,647
I say "There's that and that"

60
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,026
Many people are just shy

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,293
Maybe, when I started doing 
into the microphone

62
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,090
The contrast

63
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:11,907
Yes!

64
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:12,734
It was cool

65
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:13,496
I thougth

66
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:16,125
You make such a vibration

67
00:02:22:456 --> 00:02:24:951
Let me to don't talk

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,772
Can I film you for Stories?

69
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:33,443
Yes

70
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:17,232
Cool

71
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,587
Thank you

72
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:20,360
Nice one

73
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,130
Do you know, what is beatbox?

74
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:24,500
Yes

75
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:27,054
I do it and I'd like to show
you something

76
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:28,050
To demonstrate

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,063
Maybe, I'm able to surprise you

78
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,471
ğŸ¤– I'm a robot ğŸ¤–

79
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,000
ğŸ¤– I must ğŸ¤–

80
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,591
ğŸ¤– I'm a robot ğŸ¤–

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,242
ğŸ¤– I must ğŸ¤–

82
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:15,114
ğŸ¤– Must ğŸ¤–

83
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,562
ğŸ¤– I'm a dummy robot ğŸ¤–

84
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:20,428
ğŸ¤– I must dance ğŸ¤–

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,132
ğŸ¤– A dummy robot ğŸ¤–

86
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:23,593
ğŸ¤– Must dance ğŸ¤–

87
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:25,396
ğŸ¤– A dummy robot ğŸ¤–

88
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:27,183
ğŸ¤– I must dance ğŸ¤–

89
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,589
Cool

90
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,191
Thanks

91
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:50,348
For how long you do it?

92
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:51,869
For about 15 years

93
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,045
Really cool

94
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,581
Do you film videos for YouTube?

95
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:56,210
I film

96
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,812
How many subscribers do you have?

97
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,820
55 thousands

98
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:03,289
Actually, I film you as well

99
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,764
And if you don't mind,
I'll upload you to YouTube

100
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:08,908
Upload it 

101
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,104
You can find and watch yourself
later

102
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,543
What to search?

103
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,552
What's the device there?

104
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,194
I just do music,

105
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,086
Show everyone my talent

106
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,218
to people I drive

107
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:26,411
I can show you too,
if you don't mind

108
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:27,449
No problems

109
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:43,865
â™« How are you? â™«

110
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:44,785
â™« Amazing â™«

111
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:45,658
â™« I'm crazy amazing â™«

112
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:46,814
Can you turn it off?

113
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,000
Done. You can continue

114
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,092
â™« How are you? â™«

115
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,000
â™« Amazing â™«

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,899
â™« We're crazy amazing â™«

117
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,692
â™« We are all amazing â™«

118
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,555
â™« And crazy amazing â™«

119
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:57,451
â™« How are you? â™«

120
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:58,347
â™« Amazing â™«

121
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,211
â™« We're crazy amazing â™«

122
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:02,121
â™« We are all amazing â™«

123
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,914
â™« We're crazy amazing â™« 

124
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,265
Cool

125
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,246
Thank you

126
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:41,935
Actually, it's very, very fine

127
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,398
Thank you very much

128
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,195
Do you know what is beatbox?

129
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,091
Yes

130
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,695
I'd like to perform you,

131
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,134
I'm doing it for quite long

132
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:51,841
Let's go

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,954
It's

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
powerful vibrations

135
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:07,766
Good sound there, you feel it?

136
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,110
Yes, a lot

137
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,568
The whole body was vibrating

138
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:15,785
You can also work 
in night clubs

139
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,370
In a night club? Don't know.
I haven't tried yet.

140
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:22,083
- You know, VIP service
- Maybe, I should try

141
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,314
You need to take extra 
money for this

142
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:28,074
I'll tell my director 
to write a review

143
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,536
Thank you

144
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,000
On Yandex

145
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:37,390
You can, you know what?
Make people reactions on TikTok

146
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,853
As I already do

147
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:42,000
I wanted to tell you right now,
that I film you

148
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:43,122
You film us?

149
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:43,405
Yes

150
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:44,419
Where?

151
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,075
My whistle is also there?

152
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:49,345
Everything is there

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,084
If you don't mind I'll upload you

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,976
You can watch yourselves 
on YouTube later

155
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,255
You can type "Improver"

156
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:00,640
On YouTube?

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,342
Yes, on YouTube

158
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,078
Listen, do you know what is beatbox?

159
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:10,368
No

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,839
It's when music made with lips
and mouth

161
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,853
Maybe ever heard?

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,638
On TikTok

163
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:18,119
No

164
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,500
It's like

165
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:24,529
Have you heard 
something like this?

166
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,348
No, I don't watch TikTok at all

167
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:27,754
You don't say

168
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:31,081
I just do beatbox and
I'd like to show you something

169
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,967
To perform beatbox

170
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,056
Maybe I'll be able 
to surprise you 

171
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,233
What do you think about it?

172
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,072
Actually, it is surprising

173
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:39,762
Surprising?

174
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:42,440
Can I perform something longer?

175
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,448
A more completed piece 

176
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,000
Ok?

177
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:48,910
Well

178
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:50,766
Fine

179
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:03,130
That's it! Quiet!

180
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:04,205
Why?

181
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:07,288 
What's this? You're scared?

182
00:10:07,288  --> 00:10:08,667 
Why do you have a microphone here?

183
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:09,702
You've got scared?

184
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:13,332
No taxi has a microphone

185
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:14,732
And I have one

186
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,201
You work as a tiktok and 

187
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:21,913
a taxi driver?

188
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,257
Yes

189
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,219
I have a channel on TikTok

190
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,450
Ah, I get it

191
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:28,322
So what?

192
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,296
My friend,

193
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,953
that is in Astana, also

194
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:33,799
films TikToks

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:38,708
When I come to him, we film

196
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:40,000
You film a TikTok?

197
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,805
Not really a tiktok

198
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,260
What do you film?

199
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,146
Well

200
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:52,866
You should ask my friend
about this

201
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:57,410
Let's go and film 
a video on TikTok

202
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,566
With me

203
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,751
I'm not really can make a tiktok

204
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,584
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

205
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:08,870
ğŸ‘´ Hallo! I don't understand

206
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,591
ğŸ¤– 1, 2, 3, I'm a robot

207
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,546
Stop it! Everyone will hear us and

208
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:19,824
No one can hear us

209
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,299
Only you can hear me 
and nobody else

210
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,272
Why?

211
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:27,552
ğŸ˜ˆ Only you can hear me!

212
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,479
And why?

213
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,899
ğŸ¤– Because we're in a car

214
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:32,583
Again a wrong way?

215
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,524
No, it's a correct way! 

216
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:36,234
Where to go next?

217
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:37,593
Go back!

218
00:11:37,836 --> 00:11:38,850
Back? Why to go back? 

219
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,601
Go back

220
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,264
This way, to go left, isn't it?

221
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,644
No, go back

222
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:43,191
Where to go?

223
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:44,956
There is the house

224
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,072
I couldn't know this

225
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,938
And you didn't tell

226
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,128
Go back

227
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:51,467
Oopsie-doopsie

228
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:53,922
Tell me where to go 

229
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,338
Go this way, this way, this way,
this way

230
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:01,914
We let the car go by

231
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,118
That's all, it's gone

232
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,500
We are breaking through!

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,468
It seems, it's a wrong way

234
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,131
I don't know, again 
arrived to a wrong place

235
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,855
We're breaking through then

236
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:47,000
We can't break throguh,
we're not in a tank

237
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,089
Then go back again

238
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:53,151
Go back again

239
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,734
I got it!

240
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,715
We have only two ways

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,338
Where?

242
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:02,928
We could go from there 
or from there

243
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:07,269
Between this orange and 
that black skyscraper 

244
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,718
That's an intersting thing 
you came up with

245
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,456
Here it is, here it is, 
here it is

246
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,500
It seems we've arrived

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,596
That's all, have a good one!
